STUN (Session Traversal utils for NAT)

    Helps devices behind Network Address Translation (NAT) discover their public IP addresses and ports.

    Cannot bypass firewalls that block incoming connections


TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT)

    Acts as a relay server to facilitate communication when a direct peer-to-peer connection is impossible.

    Enables communication even when firewalls or strict NAT prevent direct connections.


Choosing the right server:

    STUN is preferred whenever possible due to its efficiency and lower resource usage.

    TURN is used as a backup solution when a direct connection fails due to firewalls or strict NAT.

In essence, STUN helps devices find each other, while TURN acts as a bridge when they can't connect directly.
