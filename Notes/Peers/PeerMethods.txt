addTrack() 

    Adds a new media track to the set of tracks which will be transmitted to the other peer.


setLocalDescription() 
 
    Changes the local description associated with the connection. 
    
    This description specifies the properties of the local end of the connection, including the media format. 

    Returns a *Promise* which is fulfilled once the description has been changed, "asynchronously".

    The method takes a single parameter â€” **session description**


signalingState

    Returns a "string" value describing the state of the signaling process on the local end of the connection,
    
    while connecting or reconnecting to another peer. 

    Allowed Values:

        1.  stable

                -   There is no ongoing exchange of offer and answer underway. 

        2.  have-local-offer

                -   The local peer has called RTCPeerConnection.setLocalDescription()

        3.  have-remote-offer

                -   The remote peer has created an offer and used the signaling server to deliver it to the local peer

        4.  have-local-pranswer

                -   The offer sent by the remote peer has been applied and an answer has been created


addIceCandidate() 

        The interface adds a "new remote candidate" to the connection's remote description, which describes the state of the remote end of the connection.


track 
        
        sent to the "ontrack" event handler on RTCPeerConnections after a new track has been added to an RTCRtpReceiver which is part of the connection.

        By the time this event is delivered, the new track has been fully added to the peer connection.
