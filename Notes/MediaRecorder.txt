MediaStream Recording API

    The MediaStream Recording API is comprised of a single major interface, "MediaRecorder", 
    which does all the work of taking the data from a MediaStream and delivering it to you for processing. 
    
    The data is delivered by a series of dataavailable events, already in the format you specify when creating the MediaRecorder. 
    
    You can then process the data further or write it to file as desired.
