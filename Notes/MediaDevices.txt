getUserMedia()
    With the user's permission through a prompt, turns on a camera and/or a microphone on the system & 
    provides a **MediaStream** containing a video track and/or an audio track with the input.
    A *Promise* whose fulfillment handler receives a MediaStream object when the requested media has successfully been obtained.


getSupportedConstraints()
    Returns a new object based on the **MediaTrackSupportedConstraints** dictionary,
    listing the constraints supported by the "user agent". 


getDisplayMedia()
    Prompts the user to select and grant permission to capture the contents of a display or portion thereof (such as a window) as a "MediaStream".
    A *Promise* that resolves to a MediaStream containing a video track whose contents come from a user-selected screen area, 
    as well as an optional audio track.


enumerateDevices()
    Requests a list of the currently available media input and output devices, such as microphones, cameras, headsets, and so forth. 
    The returned *Promise* is resolved with an **array** of "MediaDeviceInfo" objects describing the devices.
        Each object in the array describes one of the available media input and output devices. 
        The order is significant â€” the "default" capture devices will be listed **first**.


HTMLMediaElement.setSinkId() 
    The Audio Output Devices API sets the ID of the audio device to use for output and returns a *Promise*.
