The RTCPeerConnection interface represents a WebRTC connection between the local computer and a remote peer. 

It provides methods to connect to a remote peer, maintain and monitor the connection, and close the connection once it's no longer needed.

    new RTCPeerConnection(configuration)


configuration:

    iceServers (Optional):
        
        An "array" of objects, each describing one server which may be used by the ICE agent.
        These are typically STUN and/or TURN servers.


An **icecandidate** event is sent to an RTCPeerConnection when:

    1.  An RTCIceCandidate has been identified and added to the local peer by a call to RTCPeerConnection.setLocalDescription(),

    2.  Every RTCIceCandidate correlated with a particular username fragment and password combination (a generation) has been so identified and added,

    3.  All ICE gathering on all transports is complete.

In the first two cases, the event handler should transmit the candidate to the remote peer over the signaling channel 
so the remote peer can add it to its set of remote candidates.

This event is not cancelable and does not bubble.


createOffer()

    Initiates the creation of an "SDP offer" for the purpose of starting a new WebRTC connection to a remote peer.

    Returns a **Promise** which, when the offer has been created, is resolved with a "RTCSessionDescription" object containing the newly-created offer.
