MediaTrackConstraints dictionary is used to describe a set of capabilities and the value or values each can take on. 

A constraints dictionary is passed into applyConstraints() to allow a script to establish a set of exact (required) values for the track,
and the most recently-requested set of custom constraints can be retrieved by calling getConstraints().
