Signaling and video calling

    WebRTC allows real-time, peer-to-peer, media exchange between two devices. 
    
    A *connection* is established through a discovery and negotiation process called "signaling". 

    Signaling involves both devices connecting to a third, mutually agreed-upon server. (Signaling Server)
    Through this third server, the two devices can locate one another, and exchange negotiation messages.

    A signaling server's job is to serve as an "intermediary" to let two peers find and establish a connection 
    while minimizing exposure of potentially private information as much as possible. 

    
SDP (Session Description Protocol) 

    The standard describing a peer-to-peer connection. 
    
    SDP contains the codec, source address, and timing information of audio and video.

    WebRTC uses SDP as a way of "describing" a session.


ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) 

    A framework used by WebRTC (among other technologies) for connecting two peers, 
    regardless of network topology (usually for audio and video chat). 
    
    This protocol lets two peers "find" and establish a connection with one another even though 
    they may both be using NAT to share a global IP address with other devices on their respective local networks.


NAT (Network Address Translation) 

    A technique for letting multiple computers share an IP address. 
    
    NAT assigns unique addresses to each computer on the local network and adjusts incoming/outgoing network traffic to send data to the right place.
