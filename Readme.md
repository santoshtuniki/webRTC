##### WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a technology that enables Web applications and sites to capture and optionally stream audio and/or video media, as well as to exchange arbitrary data between browsers without requiring an intermediary. 

##### To share data and perform teleconferencing peer-to-peer, without requiring that the user install plug-ins or any other third-party software.
